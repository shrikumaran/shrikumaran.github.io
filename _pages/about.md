Experience

### Computer Vision reasearch intern at OriginHealth.ai
OriginHealth Pte. Ltd. (Singapore) is a startup working to simlify the process of mothers getting their ultrasound scans. Currently we face a critical shortage of radiologists to analyse ultrasound scans , this leads to long waiting times which can lead to delayed interventions in case of any anamolies. To prevent this we worked on automating the task of analysing the scans and giving feedback for the doctor to act upon. I worked on the Computer Vision team which was tasked with finding ways to implement various clinical measurement on the scans.
