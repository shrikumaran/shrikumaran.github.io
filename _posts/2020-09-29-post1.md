This post takes you through a breif introduction to GANs and then to the implementation part in PyTorch

What are GANs?
======
GAN or Generative Adversarial Network is a Neural network architecture that will generate new data that it has never seen. Generally, GANs have two Neural network models. One is called Generator and the other is Discriminator. The Generator generates a fake data(generally an image) taking a random noise as input. The Discriminator trains on the real dataset and checks whether the generated data is fake or not. What we do is we try to train the Generator such that it fools the Discriminator with its generated data.
